# Seance
Developer author's concerns are different. The purpose of this app is to create a space to make it easier for developers
to express EXACTLY what they mean. This project succeeds if it helps developers overcome the resistance they feel
when they want to share something with the world.

## Code
We need nicely formatted code to help illustrate ideas, and offer new things to the community.
We have world class tools like Github Gists for sharing and embedding code, but writing gists breaks the
author's work flow, requiring new tabs, and separate editors and repls to ensure correctness.

## Images
A picture is worth a thousand words, but having to open new tabs and fish around for the right cat gif can kill
creativity and flow. Sites like Giphy and Imgur have great search capabilities we can bring right to to author at 
write-time.

## Diagrams and Flow Charts
Like pictures, a diagram is incredibly powerful at communicating an idea. The author is left to create a graph in
a separate app, export it as an image, upload it, bring it into the piece their writing... THIS STINKS. We have great
tools like [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid) that offer a great way to generate charts and diagrams easily.
